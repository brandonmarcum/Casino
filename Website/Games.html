                                            You pick a gesture: rock, paper, or scissors. The A.I. will also pick a gesture from the same set 
                                            at the same time as you. Afterwards, the two gestures are compared. Rock beats scissors, paper 
                                            beats rock (for some reason), and scissors beats paper. You win by having the winning gesture in 
                                            comparison to the opponent.

                                            You and the dealer each draw a card. The goal is to get the total card value as close 
                                            to 21 as possible without going over. If the value is over 21 the game is over and the 
                                            person whom drew the last card loses. After each turn, you are given the option to stand 
                                            which means you cannot draw cards anymore. If both you and the dealer stands without going 
                                            over 21, the person with the greatest total value wins.

                                            The less turns you get, the greater the reward. You are given a randomly generated bingo 
                                            card. For each turn, a number will be called out. If the number matches a number in the 
                                            bingo card, it is chipped out. If a 5 chips line up horizontal, vertical, or diagonal, 
                                            you win. However, if the number of turns is up and you still haven't gotten a bingo, 
                                            you lose.

                                            Tip: Time is money! Go for the more riskier turn limits so you don't waste your time earning

                                            have it out for each other. The only information available to you is one stat from each 
                                            of the chickens. Health is the amount of health they have before they are defeated. Attack 
                                            is the amount of damage they dish out to the other chicken's health. Evasion is the odds the 
                                            chicken will avoid the other chicken's attack.

                                            Tip: Do not try pitting chickens against each other in real life, that is wrong as well as 
                                            kind of illegal. I mean c'mon not even gladiators were allowed to outright kill each other.

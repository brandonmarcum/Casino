                Casino is a mock website which is meant to simulate being at a real casino. Still, amatuer virtual 
                casinos are frowned upon by todays society so I decided to make this casino a ridiculous as possible 
                to the point where half of these games wouldn't even be remotely found in Las Vegas. This is known 
                as "Project 2" for Revature's training where two people have to create something that uses: a 
                Model-View-Controller, DevOps, Angular, and WebAPI.

            <h5>
                This website is in no way supposed to be taken seriously as a real casino, however it 
                is meant to be taken seriously as a website. If you are in any way, shape, or form offended by any 
                material I do ask you to please understand. If you have, by some miraculous chance, invested real money 
                into this gambling website, I am very curious as to how you were able to do that and I will take notes 
                on the matter. For personal reasons, of course.

                                If you went to a real casino and ask to play rock-paper-scissors for chips, they'd kick you out. But not in my
                                casino. Here, you get a fair right at playing rock-paper-scissors with a pure random bot.

                                do you have what it takes to outwit the dealer?

                            home. Get a card and it will fill the numbers for you. It's like a lottery ticket that you can actually win.

                            I must say, what's wrong with you? However, if you want that experience without the risk, try out virtual 
                            Russian Roulette.

                                Yes, you read that right. Two chickens boiling angry at each other want to fight. Since this is a virtual 
                                casino, we obviously don't use real chickens which makes this completely legal.
